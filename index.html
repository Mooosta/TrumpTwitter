            <h2><b>Art of Speech:</b> Simplicity in communication</h2><br>
            <p>Trump is an unusual US president that speaks differently from all his predecessor. He tweets without a second thought, nor cares about potential negative implication or consequence it might cause afterwards. He disregards the fact that his words will be analysed to be used against himself.

Other than Pronouns of his favourite, some of his favourite buzz words are <b>"MAGA", "fake", "great", "sad" and "will"</b>, each carries a strong emotive value that expresses his emotion easily. He loves rhythmic talk, continuous repetition of his favourite buzz words, in conjunction with ending his tweets on strong punchy keyword. All these small details aid him to express his stance on implicated topic easily, implicating the listener agreed on his point, framing negative response as over-reaction, in doing so embeds his ideas deep into the reader's impression.</p>

            <h3>Difference in speaking connotation</h3><br>
            <p>For example, compare to 44th United of States President - Barack Obama tweets in a cleaner and eloquent manner whilst Trump talks more informal and emotional, his tweet rather gives a colloquial feel, and resembles how normal people uses social media. As discussed in the previous section, Trump favours speaking in a short sentence, fewer characters and syllables per word as possible. Trump may not be a smart nor informed speaker, but is witty and has good comedic sense, relatable language that resonates better with the public.</p>

            <p>Been underestimated, Trump was successful in utilising Twitter as an effective medium to communicate with the crowd throughout his presidency. This allows reflection: Twitter is a constantly changing system especially the nature of political discourse on the platform subtle shifts in the distribution of users' preference in content like more spam and less in-depth conversation. New mechanisms for information sharing have consequences for contagion <i style="color:#a7b1bf75"> (Minot, Arnold, Alshaabi, Danforth & Dodds, 2021) </i> .

            <p>Seeing the underlying trend, Trump took the opportunity to grasp the psychology that American citizens are tired of hearing politicians' constantly being sophisticated-sounding, yet accomplish little or nothing. Trump been elected was a change of pace in the political world, break of stereotypical politician impression. His whole 'Twitter career' can be summarised up with White House Spokesman's description "people critiquing his use of it (controversial tweets) now critiqued it during the election and it turned out pretty well for him".</p>
